# XPS15TouchpadAndUSBFix
Contains a simple powershell script, which fixes XPS15 touchpad and USB issues, by disabling power managment on them.

In order for the fix to properly work, schedule the powershell script to run on startup with elevated permissions. Otherwise, the fix will stop working after each reboot.
